"To me, it all comes down to things being character-driven. It's hard for me to look beyond that. CG and all this cool stuff - so be it. But to me, it pretty much begins and ends with character-driven plots rather than technologically-driven plots.",Billy West,cool,2
"The nude scenes were a little eerie and I felt a bit odd. Yeah, when the camera scanned up my body, I said to my friend, 'Now, that's a close-up.' I mean, you see every inch of my body. But I'm okay with it and so it was cool.",Natasha Henstridge,cool,2
"Almost any film that you do is an opportunity to open you up and make you more aware of an area that you might not be thinking about. That's what is kind of cool, or one of the cool things about this profession.",Joan Allen,cool,2

"I remember being in Atlantic City once when I was 18 or 19, and a sea of people were screaming and pulling their hair because I was there. It was weird. Nobody deserves adulation like that. I tried to explain it to my kids once. I said, 'Mommy used to be kind of cool, kind of like a Britney Spears.'",Genie Francis,cool,2
"It was really cool to work with Dakota Fanning. I've watched her grow up and I've always loved her films, loved her.

We got on really well she's so professional and hardworking.",Kaya Scodelario,cool,2
"My niece was very much caught up in the vampire craze for young adults, and she thought having a vampire boyfriend would be a cool thing. What do you do on a first date? The more I thought about it, the more fun I had imagining what you'd serve a vampire for dinner.",Deborah Harkness,cool,2

She is 100% true. She puts on no shows, because she is so comfortable with herself.",Evanna Lynch,cool,2

I love almost all of the characters I've played.",Alanna Ubach,cool,2
"That wasn't the way that things was supposed to be.

"Now that I finally have the time for it, this web surfing stuff turns out to be as interesting and fun and addictive as you've all been telling me. Zipping from link to link, chasing an idea across the noosphere, sucking up information like a killer whale - way cool.",Spider Robinson,cool,2
"I hate it when people come up to me on trains and ask 'Are you Soulja Boy?' If people want pictures or autographs, that's cool, but I don't like the dumb questions.",Soulja Boy,cool,2
"I love my mother Ali so much. I'm a momma's boy. I just have a very cool mom. It's not as though I had any say in the matter. I'm just really fortunate. She's the most kind, loving, giving woman.",Hayden Christensen,cool,2

"Cool things happen. Ace's guitar flies through space, goes through a hole, and blows up. I throw drumsticks and they come flying at you.",Peter Criss,cool,2

"I work with really cool people, and so far I haven't been approached in any embarrassing manner when it comes to image.",Sondre Lerche,cool,2

"I was a dancer, and it's not really cool for a boy to dance, so it was inspiring to see a movie like 'Footloose' where a guy is dancing masculine and had a proper reason behind it.

Atlanta is an incredibly cool city.,Andrew Lincoln,cool,2
"I liked the way my character, Shane, was first introduced. You get introduced to her through this sexual action, and I thought that was so cool and just kind of summed up what she enjoys and who she is, to a certain extent. She's a complete sexual being and the great thing is that she doesn't apologize for it. It's just who she is. We rarely see women be able to do that on television.",Katherine Moennig,cool,2
"What I like about the 'Underworld' thing is that it's a mix of cool genres, as well as creating its own message.",Theo James,cool,2

"Again, like I said, we're not trying to censor anyone. If you think drugs are cool, fine. Make that movie. We are not going to stop you, or try to stop you, but we would encourage other people to be a bit more responsible about their portrayal of drug usage.",Gerald McRaney,cool,2

"When I was in high school, my friends and I would drive out into the country to abandoned houses and structures... haha... to ghost hunt. We would scare each other so bad!

Being a kid and growing up is such a cool part of life.,Devon Werkheiser,cool,2

"Everyone is different, but I'm not standoffish at all. I'm not one of those people who prefer to write a note. I'll walk right up to you and ask you out! Even if the answer's no, I'm totally cool with it.",Corbin Bleu,cool,2
"I am a very open, social, friendly person, and when it comes to people approaching me and asking for an autograph, I am totally cool with doing any of that. It's a lot of fun.",Corbin Bleu,cool,2
"A couple days ago, I saw a lot of people tweeting, 'Oh, it's so cool 'Home' is being used in the Olympics!' We don't really get to watch much TV, man, with the concerts every night, but I wish I could have seen it. I really just found out through Twitter and my management texting me. I thought it was really awesome.",Phillip Phillips,cool,2
I think there are four or five interesting pockets where a lot of cool technology companies are getting started. Chicago is one of them. New York is certainly another. Silicon Valley really dominates. And you're seeing some stuff out of Boston and Seattle and down South.,Eric Lefkofsky,cool,2
"And getting stunt coordinator Dan Bradley and everybody from the whole 'Bourne Supremacy' crew, I think was real cool for our film because we do a bunch of really big jumps in this movie.",Sean William Scott,cool,2
"I just thought it could make a really cool movie. It's not that it's just a buddy comedy but it's all about two guys hating each other and towards the end they're good friends. I liked that these two guys were best friends from the very beginning, and they're crazy.",Sean William Scott,cool,2
I think it's really cool to embrace the pain of something that may have hurt you and be able to express it through music.,Ciara,cool,2
"People spend hours constantly checking and tweeting and Facebooking. And it's cool to check up on your friends and see what's going on in the world, but it's not cool to spend five hours of your day on the computer looking at the Internet.",Ty Segall,cool,2
"Well, I look at it like this: When you go to a restaurant, the less you know about what happens in the kitchen, the more you enjoy your meal. If the soup tastes good, everything's cool, and you don't necessarily want to know what's in it. The same thing holds true with movies.",Jeffrey Wright,cool,2
"It's really cool to know that you've put something together that isn't for a particular audience. It's so often that a TV show can really only speak to one sect of the population, and this really is something that appeals to a worldwide fan base. People who are into the pursuit of knowledge. Their reaction has meant the world to us.",David Krumholtz,cool,2
"I've always been into guitars... we want to put keyboards on, but keyboard players don't look cool onstage, they just keep their heads down. There has never been a cool keyboard player, apart from Elton John.",Noel Gallagher,cool,2

"White people couldn't do black music back in the day because they weren't funky or bad enough. They weren't from the ghettoes, but hip-hop and R&ampB changed all of that because white kids want to be down with it. They wanted to learn it so they studied the culture. It's kind of a cool thing because we shouldn't be so separate.",Narada Michael Walden,cool,2

"I've done four other films since 'Submarine,' so that's quite cool. It's just good to have people respect your work I've never had that before. Yeah, my life has changed crazy. I'm a kid from a small town in south Wales, I play my Xbox usually and all that sort of stuff, and it's a whole new world.",Craig Roberts,cool,2
The 'Being Human' people were really cool and let me improvise. They had such a good working atmosphere. It was a cool set-up and a really good environment to be in.,Craig Roberts,cool,2
"I'm getting a lot of stick because my character in 'Young Dracula' wanted to be vampire, so now that I am a vampire, everyone's like, 'You finally did it!' But it's cool and I loved doing 'Young Dracula.' That show's finished and I don't know why it ended, so it was brilliant to go into 'Being Human,' which is like the adult version of it.",Craig Roberts,cool,2
"I'd love to pop back into 'Being Human' as Adam. I love the character so much. I've never really played a character like that. I'm always playing the geek, so to play a kid who is very energetic when he wants to be, and who is always trying to get the girls, was really cool.",Craig Roberts,cool,2
"I want to speak up and tell you that mascara and clothes don't make you cool, neither do name-brand handbags, but being a leader can.",Renee Olstead,cool,2

"They use all of the music that I did in the '50s, '60s and the '70s behind people like Tupac and LL Cool J. I'm into all that stuff.",Donald Byrd,cool,2
I feel like my music is just an extension of my acting. I treat the songs like scenes that tell a story... it's very similar. My favorite thing is when cartoon fans show up to my live gigs! They are always the most kick-butt audience members 'cause they're not trying to act all cool like a lot of the music fans do! It's refreshing!!,Grey DeLisle,cool,2

"In the old days, a TV sync was perceived as not so cool or whittling away at your indie cred. Now it's seen as much more of an opportunity than a sellout, as a way to find fans who wouldn't have ordinarily come across their genre of music.",Alexandra Patsavas,cool,2
"I am working on a dress sock line of funky, colorful, cool designs.",Rob Kardashian,cool,2

"I used to do this as a kid. And now they're paying me for it, which is cool.",William Kempe,cool,2
"L.A.'s cool I had a run with it to where it just pretty much wore me out. I love the weather and I have great friends there, great family, but I really cannot take a lot of the culture. Like Nashville, where everybody's a songwriter, everybody out there is an actor.",Shooter Jennings,cool,2

"Film and television are just different. Film is cool because it's a complete package. You know the beginning, middle, and end. You can plan it out more, which I like. But with television you get a new script every week, so it's constantly a mystery as to what you're going to be doing.",Austin Butler,cool,2

I had to act in a school play when I was about ten years old. I really didn't want to do it. But everyone had to do it so I didn't have a choice. A talent agent came and watched it and later gave me some work. It's funny because I'd always known that I wanted a movie career. I just didn't think that I would be in the movies.,Kristen Stewart,funny,4
"I'm like, bursting. I should be working. I don't want to take a break. It's funny, on set, I don't have to go to the bathroom, I don't have anything wrong, I'm perfectly fine, so through-and-through. I'm not hungry. I'm literally not even in my own body.",Kristen Stewart,funny,4

"It's not an accident that both my sister and I are writers. Our parents created an accidental Petri dish. My family has great storytellers, and I grew up in a very funny, conversational house and didn't have television.

There's something dangerous about what's funny. Jarring and disconcerting. There is a connection between funny and scary.,Christopher Walken,funny,4

I always like to watch comics and it's interesting that you can tell if someone's funny in 10 seconds.,Christopher Walken,funny,4

"Funny enough, if you are looking at people these days who are putting Botox in their face and getting all sorts of plastic surgery, we look at them and go, I can tell you've had Botox.

"I'm not funny. People assume that because my books are funny, I'll be funny in real life. It's the inevitable disappointment of meeting me.",Jonathan Safran Foer,funny,4
"You find out in life that people really like you funny. So what do you give 'em? Humor. And then if you show them the other side, they don't like you as much. I find, too, that I can hide behind the idiot's mask being funny, and you never see the sorrow or the pain.",Terry Bradshaw,funny,4

I thought I was funny as a kid.,Jo Brand,funny,4
"It used to be that you had to make female TV characters perfect so no one would be offended by your 'portrayal' of women.

People don't want to listen to a celebrity tweeting about their charities and shows. That's why comedy writers do well - we put out little funny ideas.,Mindy Kaling,funny,4
"The reason why you know more funny dudes than funny chicks is that dudes are funnier than chicks.

Because they'll have to hire you, they can't really fire you, and you don't have to produce that much. It'll be awesome.'",Adam Carolla,funny,4
"I don't hate humanity and I'm not interested in people who do. Although, it's funny, actually, some of my favorite writers really do. Like Martin Amis. My dirty secret.

"I used to say, 'Man, I think I'd be a really good dad. I'll be a great provider. I'm funny I'll go on trips with them - I'll do all sorts of stuff.' But the momming? I'm not made for that. I have a really good mom I know what she put into it.",Elizabeth Gilbert,funny,4

"It's a funny show. The characters are surprisingly likable, given how ugly they are. We've got this huge cast of characters that we can move around. And over the last few seasons, we've explored some of the secondary characters' personal lives a bit more.",Matt Groening,funny,4
"Laurence Olivier said in an interview once that when he plays a tragedy he always aims for the funny parts, and the other way around. Because in a comedy you look for what's serious.

"I mean, sometimes... a comedian becomes an actor, and they just don't deliver, because the bottom line of comedy is to be funny, and the bottom line of acting is to be truthful, and they get that mixed up sometimes, or don't even notice that that's the thing.",Eddie Izzard,funny,4
I need to be cheered up a lot. I think funny people are people who need to be cheered up.,Lynda Barry,funny,4

"It's not so much what you learn about Mumbai, it's what you learn about yourself, really. It's a funny old hippie thing, but it's true as well. You find out a lot about yourself and your tolerance, and about your inclusiveness.",Danny Boyle,funny,4
"I was lucky. My family is wonderful. And it's funny, because most of my best friends come from very large families. So it always felt as if I had lots of siblings, though in the end I had to leave them and go home. I kind of got the best of both worlds as a kid.",Sophia Bush,funny,4
"I think there have always been funny women, from Carol Burnett to Joan Rivers. When the audience sees a woman, they innately know she's worked twice as hard to get there, she's had to prove that she can be the leader, first, and then be funny on top of it. She has to emit a confidence that she's in control.",Wendy Liebman,funny,4

"It's funny, when bands or younger musicians ask me: 'So, what does it take to make it?' Well, first explain to me what you mean by 'making it': Do you want to be a rock star or do you want music to be your livelihood?",Eddie Van Halen,funny,4
"I mean it's funny, playing music, how of course you want it to do well, you want them to like it, but it's not competitive like an election, it's the Olympics, it's not a Formula 1 race. The Billboard charts are just to show you what people like.",Eddie Van Halen,funny,4
It's funny how making odd noises can get you into strange situations sometimes.,Eric San,funny,4

"People ask 'do you make a conscious effort not to swear?' - if you're doing silly stuff you're not tempted to put swearing in. All the comics from my childhood, who were funny without swearing, were the people that influenced me. What I do is quite traditional anyway.",Tim Vine,funny,4
"I always find it kind of embarrassing, kind of funny, and kind of exciting. In New York I'm recognized a lot, although nobody says anything. You know, they stare at you just a second too long. But in Paris it's not as commonplace to be recognized.",Marc Jacobs,funny,4
"I don't think, 'Gee, I'd like to dress this person.' There was a picture in Us magazine. It was a jersey dress, and Courtney Love was wearing it. I have this thing about Courtney Love, this funny worship.",Marc Jacobs,funny,4

"You know, I've always thought that it would be really funny if somebody made a romantic comedy where absolutely everything went well from beginning to end.",Fiona Apple,funny,4

"I don't have a caustic sense of humor. What I find funny, that humor comes from a much gentler place.",Vera Farmiga,funny,4
"On the stage you're there, it's live. There's a beginning, a middle, an end. When something is funny you hear it right away.",Theodore Bikel,funny,4
"Some of the writers I admire who seem very, very funny and very emotional to me can develop a closeness with the reader without giving too much of themselves away. Lorrie Moore comes to mind, as does David Sedaris. When they write, the reader thinks that they're being trusted as a friend.",Sloane Crosley,funny,4
I think a lot of humor is about distracting yourself. Pretend you're not trying to make it funny. Because for some reason the effort to be funny smells like sulphur in our culture.,Sloane Crosley,funny,4
"It's funny. People often compare me to other humor essayists. They're usually quite nice comparisons I will accept those gladly. But I am always sort of appalled at the idea of being lumped with other, more chick-y female writers. And the truth is probably that neither comparison is accurate.",Sloane Crosley,funny,4

"For a culture that has such a problem with death, we seem to deal with it in a quite bizarre way. We see people shot, killed and blown up, and we find it funny and sexy and all those things.

I'm never afraid to try something if I think it's funny. And I know I'll regret it if I don't.,Seann William Scott,funny,4
"Here is my prescription to heal all wounds. Watch the film 'Funny Girl' at least five times, eat at least 45 chocolate bars, and hang out with all those friends you blew off to hang out with your ex. I truly believe that, through a combination of Nutella, old pals and Barbra Streisand, we can achieve happiness and, very probably, world peace.",Beth Ditto,funny,4
"My size has helped make me an amazing performer too. The cliche of the Funny Fat Friend: I absolutely was that character - I am that character... It's a complicated bag of tools I acquired, and I've put them all to work onstage.",Beth Ditto,funny,4
"It sounds funny, but the 2008 Olympics were something that just kind of happened, and I was lucky they came at a point when I was uninjured and well prepared. As a gymnast, you can't ask for much more.",Shawn Johnson,funny,4
"I think I have an inner confidence that my tastes are pretty simple, that what I find funny finds a wide audience. I'm not particularly intellectual or clever or minority-focused in my creative instincts. And I'm certainly not aware of suppressing more sophisticated ambitions.",Rowan Atkinson,funny,4

"This may sound funny, but as much as the 'Today' show matured me, it also was something of a cocoon. I'd been happy there. I never went into the boss's office and pounded my fist on the desk, saying, 'Give me more money! Give me a prime-time show!'",Jane Pauley,funny,4

"Especially with a comedy, you've got the clear cut goal of trying to make a scene funny. It's not like drama where you're trying to achieve some kind of emotion or trying to further the story along. You're trying to figure out what's the funniest way to do something.",Luke Wilson,funny,4
"I've started looking at my own father a bit funny. He assures me, though, that I really am the son of a Scottish postman.",Craig Ferguson,funny,4

I don't just try to be funny.,Bil Keane,funny,4
"It's harder to be funny if you're handsome than if you're very normal-looking. It's just more relatable. You're the underdog.

"I think we're the only jokeless show on television. I mean really, we have no setups and no punch lines. It's not a joke show.

"What I don't like is when I see stuff that I know has had a lot of improv done or is playing around where there's no purpose to the scene other than to just be funny. What you don't want is funny scene, funny scene, funny scene, and now here's the epiphany scene and then the movie's over.",Paul Feig,funny,4
Women's humor seems to be a little more supportive. It's just kind of trying to make the other one laugh through funny voices and kind of talking about other people. I respond to that.

Of course, when I worked with Charlie he was getting older.",Tippi Hedren,funny,4
I actually find novels that are determined to be funny at every turn quite oppressive.,Ian Mcewan,funny,4

"The American audience has really opened up to women being A.) funny and B.) kinda crude. 'Bridesmaids' is R-rated, and I think it was a major coup for women to have an R-rated comedy that did really well. Same as 'Bad Teacher.'",Chris Pratt,funny,4
It's interesting - I always thought when I was doing more melodramatic stuff like 'Everwood' that the directors were constantly reeling me in and stopping me from being funny.,Chris Pratt,funny,4
"The key is just to ignore the pain, because physical comedy only works if you see someone get hurt and they aren't actually hurt. If someone gets hit in the face with a bat, falls down, and gets back up, it's funny. If they stay down and their jaw is wired shut in the next scene, it's really tragic and weird. You have to pretend it doesn't hurt.",Chris Pratt,funny,4
It's a funny relationship that makeup artists have. I always feel kind of like a dentist. People look at me and think of pain.,Rick Baker,funny,4
"I love Charlie, Billy Burke's character. Writing for him is so spectacular, he's so funny and wry and every scene he's in he just takes. There's a scene in 'Eclipse' where Bella tells him she's a virgin, and it's the funniest, most awkward scene I've ever seen on film.",Melissa Rosenberg,funny,4
"It's funny how I use social media because I don't use it to promote my restaurants that much. I use it for social issues and I think that's what it's for.

"Scream was great for what it was. For a horror film, it was intelligent, it was funny, it took a laugh at itself.",Neve Campbell,funny,4
"When I was a kid, I wanted to be serious, like Daniel Day-Lewis. No one really dreams of being a comic actor, do they? Now I realise how stupid that is - and it's because comic acting isn't taken seriously enough. It's a discipline. You know instantly - either you're funny and getting the laughs, or you're not.",Chris O'Dowd,funny,4

It's funny that I got to do 'On the Road' because the thing that had the biggest impact on me growing up was reading books. I was very inspired by the book and this spirit of Dean Moriarty and how envious we all are of somebody who can be that carefree.,Garrett Hedlund,funny,4
"It's funny - I read that women look to chiseled-faced guys for one-night stands, and to round-faced guys for marriage. When I'm rounder in the face, I like to say, 'This is my long-term look.' Or 'This is my wife-and-kids look right here.'",Garrett Hedlund,funny,4
"This is the great thing about Northern Ireland. I walk down the street and people stop me and say things like, 'I know you. You're that wee golfer, aren't you?' I say, 'Yeah, that's me.'

"Being funny with a funny voice is more my comfort zone, a broader character that I try to humanize, a kind of silly or wacky persona that I try to fill in.",Hank Azaria,funny,4

I think it's really important for celebrities to use their power of money and fame to get their voices out there. It's funny to me that we're expected to keep quiet just because of who we are. Why do I lose my right to speak my mind because I'm famous?,Lisa Edelstein,funny,4
"I'm not a movie guy, I'm not a TV sitcom guy, but whatever seems to fit and is funny is good for me.",Dave Attell,funny,4

"Gotta stay in the gym, stay funny, stay sharp. I just love working.",Marlon Wayans,funny,4

"I don't think of myself as a comedian, but as an artist, a scientist and chemist who just happens to be funny. I started doing stand-up to add another level to my game. I feel that I'm a young rookie with a veteran's skill.",Marlon Wayans,funny,4

"I remember listening to the radio as a kid and finding that the songs always made me feel more peaceful. Funny, but the more hurtin' the music was, the better it made me feel.

"When I was in college, I was in the theater department, which for anyone who has been involved in any kind of theater program, you know that it's really wacky and tight-knit, a real family. Me and my good friends from college would do random shows and plays that were sometimes serious, but most of the time really goofy and funny.",Darren Criss,funny,4

It is funny what a year can do.,Victor Cruz,funny,4

"I watched a lot of silent directors who were absolutely great like John Ford and Fritz Lang, Tod Browning, and also some very modern directors like The Coen Brothers.

"What I fell in love with as a child was 'My Fair Lady,' 'Funny Face,' 'American in Paris,' and 'Singin' in the Rain.' Just perfect movies to me and I was dancing. I started ballet when I was three.

I was about seven and I sang a song called, 'Jesus, I Heard You Had a Big House' and I remember people standing up at the end and me thinking, 'Oh, I think I'm going to like this.'

I thought to spend my declining years writing poetry and teaching - but that won't pay the Bergdorf's bill. I think I'll move to somewhere life is cheaper.,Erica Jong,poetry,2

"You know, in my music career there was a moment where the irony was just so heavy. There were people in my audience that were the reason I developed neuroses. These people that tortured my life were using my art, my poetry, as fuel for them, to torture other people.",Fred Durst,poetry,2
"Poetry is adolescence fermented, and thus preserved.",Jose Ortega y Gasset,poetry,2

"But every great scripture, whether Hebrew, Indian, Persian, or Chinese, apart from its religious value will be found to have some rare and special beauty of its own and in this respect the original Bible stands very high as a monument of sublime poetry and of artistic prose.",Lafcadio Hearn,poetry,2
Poetry and music are very good friends. Like mommies and daddies and strawberries and cream - they go together.,Nikki Giovanni,poetry,2

Poetry lies its way to the truth.,John Ciardi,poetry,2

"Maybe it is something to do with age, but I have become fonder of poetry than of prose.",Aung San Suu Kyi,poetry,2
"Living here on Earth, we breathe the rhythms of a universe that extends infinitely above us. When resonant harmonies arise between this vast outer cosmos and the inner human cosmos, poetry is born.",Daisaku Ikeda,poetry,2

"My dad is a Jack Nicholson lookalike and a frustrated performer, my mother's into reading and poetry. I suppose the thing I owe them most is my confidence.",Michael Sheen,poetry,2

"In poetry, you must love the words, the ideas and the images and rhythms with all your capacity to love anything at all.",Wallace Stevens,poetry,2
"If poetry should address itself to the same needs and aspirations, the same hopes and fears, to which the Bible addresses itself, it might rival it in distribution.",Wallace Stevens,poetry,2

"My subject is War, and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity.",Wilfred Owen,poetry,2

A lot happens by accident in poetry.,Howard Nemerov,poetry,2
"I think there was a revolution in poetry, associated chiefly with Eliot and Pound but maybe it is of the nature of revolutions or of the nature of history that their innovations should later come to look trivial or indistinguishable from technical tricks.",Howard Nemerov,poetry,2

I have to admit that I had a lot of problems with poetry.,Jane Campion,poetry,2
"And, I mean, I think poetry does need to be met to some extent, especially, I guess, 19th century poetry, and for me, it's just been so worth the effort. It's like I'm planting a garden in my head.",Jane Campion,poetry,2
"Poetry is rather an approach to things, to life, than it is typographical production.",Joseph Brodsky,poetry,2

Poetry is the deification of reality.,Edith Sitwell,poetry,2
"While also, importantly, not wanting to dumb it down or pretend the days of 'difficult' poetry are over, because we live in a pluralist culture and there's room for 'difficult' poetry alongside rap and everything else.

"If epic poetry is a definite species, the sagas do not fall within it.",Lascelles Abercrombie,poetry,2
"That is to say, epic poetry has been invented many times and independently but, as the needs which prompted the invention have been broadly similar, so the invention itself has been.",Lascelles Abercrombie,poetry,2
"The reason can only be this: heroic poetry depends on an heroic age, and an age is heroic because of what it is, not because of what it does.",Lascelles Abercrombie,poetry,2
"Traditional matter must be glorified, since it would be easier to listen to the re-creation of familiar stories than to quite new and unexpected things the listeners, we must remember, needed poetry chiefly as the re-creation of tired hours.",Lascelles Abercrombie,poetry,2

"Unfortunately, poetry is not born in noise, in crowds, or on a bus. There have to be four walls and the certainty that the telephone will not ring. That's what writing is all about.",Wislawa Szymborska,poetry,2
"In the language of poetry, where every word is weighed, nothing is usual or normal. Not a single stone and not a single cloud above it. Not a single day and not a single night after it. And above all, not a single existence, not anyone's existence in this world.",Wislawa Szymborska,poetry,2
"Solitude is very important in my work as a mode of inspiration, but isolation is not good in this respect. I am not writing poetry about isolation.",Wislawa Szymborska,poetry,2

"On July 26, 1916, I announced to all my friends in America that from now on I resolved to write no more poems in the classical language, and to begin my experiments in writing poetry in the so-called vulgar tongue of the people.",Hu Shih,poetry,2
There may be more poetry than justice in poetic justice.,George Will,poetry,2
Translation is an interestingly different way to be involved both with poetry and with the language that I've found myself living in much of the time. I think the two feed each other.,Marilyn Hacker,poetry,2
"Poetry isn't a profession, it's a way of life. It's an empty basket you put your life into it and make something out of that.",Mary Oliver,poetry,2
"Most poetry in the modern age has retreated to the private sphere, turning its back on the political realm.",Terry Eagleton,poetry,2
"Poetry is the most subtle of the literary arts, and students grow more ingenious by the year at avoiding it. If they can nip around Milton, duck under Blake and collapse gratefully into the arms of Jane Austen, a lot of them will.",Terry Eagleton,poetry,2
I think that it's more likely that in my 60s and 70s I will be writing poetry rather than fiction.,Robert Morgan,poetry,2
Pound's translation of Chinese poetry was maybe the most important thing I read. Eliot a little bit later.,Robert Morgan,poetry,2

"The great watershed of modern poetry is French, more than English.",Robert Morgan,poetry,2
Among the American contemporaries I read with most enjoyment are several North Carolinians. I think the best poetry being written these days is being written by Southerners.,Robert Morgan,poetry,2
The Language Poets are writing only about language itself. The Ashbery poets are writing only about poetry itself. That seems to me a kind of dead end.,Robert Morgan,poetry,2
"Our most famous writers are Faulkner and Eudora Welty and Flannery O'Connor. It would make sense that the poetry would reflect some of those same values, some of the same techniques.",Robert Morgan,poetry,2
"Poetry, almost by definition, calls attention to its language and form.",Robert Morgan,poetry,2
The decision to write in prose instead of poetry is made more by the readers than by writers. Almost no one is interested in reading narrative in verse.,Robert Morgan,poetry,2
"Teaching writing over the years intrudes on your own writing in important ways, taking away some of the excitement of poetry.",Robert Morgan,poetry,2
"I don't think poetry is something that can be taught. We can encourage young writers, but what you can't teach them is the very essence of poetry.",Robert Morgan,poetry,2

"Some people swear by writing courses, but whether it really helps American poetry, I have doubts.",Robert Morgan,poetry,2
"I don't think American poetry has gotten any better in the past 35 years. Oddly enough, creative writing programs seem to have been good for fiction, and I would not have predicted that.",Robert Morgan,poetry,2
"I love to compare different time frames. Poetry can evoke the time of the subject. By a very careful choice of words you can evoke an era, completely throw the poem into a different time scale.",Robert Morgan,poetry,2
"One of the most powerful devices of poetry is the use of distortions. You can go from talking about the way a minute passes to the way a century passes, or a lifetime.",Robert Morgan,poetry,2
"Alchemy is the art of far and near, and I think poetry is alchemy in that way. It's delightful to distort size, to see something that's tiny as though it were vast.",Robert Morgan,poetry,2
"A poem in form still has to have voice, gesture, a sense of discovery, a metaphoric connection, as any poetry does.",Robert Morgan,poetry,2
The fact that something is in a rhymed form or in blank verse will not make it good poetry.,Robert Morgan,poetry,2
"What actually makes poetry poetry is of course impossible to define. We recognize it when we hear it, when we see it, but we can't define it.",Robert Morgan,poetry,2
"The idea of avant-garde art is a very suspicious thing to me, the idea that poetry is new and it keeps being new the way Chevrolets every year are new.",Robert Morgan,poetry,2
"Part of what we love about poetry is the fact that it seems ancient, that it has an authority of ancient language and ancient form, and that it's timeless, that it reaches back.",Robert Morgan,poetry,2
The young people have MTV and rock and roll. Why would they go to read poetry? Poetry belongs to the Stone Age. It awakens in us perceptions that go back to those times.,Robert Morgan,poetry,2

"With Shakespeare and poetry, a new world was born. New dreams, new desires, a self consciousness was born. I desired to know to know myself in terms of the new standards set by these books.",Peter Abrahams,poetry,2

It's like I understand images and some people understand poetry.,Samantha Morton,poetry,2
"Poetry is a mere drug, Sir.",George Farquhar,poetry,2

You campaign in poetry. You govern in prose.,Mario Cuomo,poetry,2
"Those who say we should dismantle the role of Poet Laureate altogether, the trick they miss is that being called this thing, with the weight of tradition behind it, and with the association of the Royal family, does allow you to have conversations and to open doors, and wallets, for the good of poetry in a way that nothing else would allow.",Andrew Motion,poetry,2
"Poetry is at the centre of my life, too, emotionally speaking, and intellectually speaking - it's just that I'm one of those people who enjoy doing other stuff as well.",Andrew Motion,poetry,2
"I'm not precisely saying that a really good board meeting at the MLA (Museums, Libraries and Archives Coucil) makes me want to go and write poetry, but there is a pleasure in doing that sort of thing well.",Andrew Motion,poetry,2
"In a general way, I want to be a kind of flag-waver, bunting hanger-up, drum-beater, you name it, for poetry.",Andrew Motion,poetry,2
"Thanks partly to the kind of poets that we now have and partly to funding, there's been a gigantic shift in the way poetry is perceived... Poems on the Underground, poets in schools, football clubs, zoos.",Andrew Motion,poetry,2
"I wanted to reimagine the role, in a way that was respectful of its traditional responsibilities but made them part of a wider pattern of poetry about national incidents, events, preoccupations and to spend a great deal of time going to schools trying to demystify poetry.",Andrew Motion,poetry,2
More people are reading poetry now than at any time in the history of the human race.,Andrew Motion,poetry,2
"Poetry is a special use of language that opens onto the real. The business of the poet is truth telling, which is why in the Celtic tradition no one could be a teacher unless he or she was a poet.",Huston Smith,poetry,2
"This is a good time to ask apologists for the Islamic regime, who degrades Islam? Who imposes stoning, forced marriage of underage girls and flogging for not wearing the veil? Do such practices represent Iran's ancient history and culture, its ethnic and religious diversity? Its centuries of sensual and subversive poetry?",Azar Nafisi,poetry,2
Poetry and consumption are the most flattering of diseases.,William Shenstone,poetry,2
"The lines of poetry, the period of prose, and even the texts of Scripture most frequently recollected and quoted, are those which are felt to be preeminently musical.",William Shenstone,poetry,2
"Cut quarrels out of literature, and you will have very little history or drama or fiction or epic poetry left.",Robert Staughton Lynd,poetry,2
"A very intimate sense of the expressiveness of outward things, which ponders, listens, penetrates, where the earlier, less developed consciousness passed lightly by, is an important element in the general temper of our modern poetry.",Walter Pater,poetry,2
"That sense of a life in natural objects, which in most poetry is but a rhetorical artifice, was, then, in Wordsworth the assertion of what was for him almost literal fact.",Walter Pater,poetry,2
"Many attempts have been made by writers on art and poetry to define beauty in the abstract, to express it in the most general terms, to find some universal formula for it.",Walter Pater,poetry,2
"Such discussions help us very little to enjoy what has been well done in art or poetry, to discriminate between what is more and what is less excellent in them, or to use words like beauty, excellence, art, poetry, with a more precise meaning than they would otherwise have.",Walter Pater,poetry,2
"I wrote some bad poetry that I published in North African journals, but even as I withdrew into this reading, I also led the life of a kind of young hooligan.",Jacques Derrida,poetry,2
"All those authors there, most of whom of course I've never met. That's the poetry side, that's the prose side, that's the fishing and miscellaneous behind me. You get an affection for books that you've enjoyed.",Norman MacCaig,poetry,2
"And if they haven't got poetry in them, there's nothing you can do that will produce it.",Norman MacCaig,poetry,2
"And the second question, can poetry be taught? I didn't think so.",Norman MacCaig,poetry,2
"However, I learned something. I thought that if the young person, the student, has poetry in him or her, to offer them help is like offering a propeller to a bird.",Norman MacCaig,poetry,2
I never think about poetry except when I'm writing it. I mean my poetry.,Norman MacCaig,poetry,2
I was very interested in American poetry for many years. Much less now.,Norman MacCaig,poetry,2
"In fact a lot of them I think are absolute baloney. Those Charles Olsens and people like that. At first I was interested in seeing what they were up to, what they were doing, why they were doing it. They never moved me in the way that one is moved by true poetry.",Norman MacCaig,poetry,2
"When I was asked to be Writer in Residence at Edinburgh I thought, you can't teach poetry. This is ridiculous.",Norman MacCaig,poetry,2

"Today the U.S. is farther from being nourished by poetry than it was a hundred years ago, when books of poems were best-sellers.",James Broughton,poetry,2
"In the world of poetry there are would-be poets, workshop poets, promising poets, lovesick poets, university poets, and a few real poets.",James Broughton,poetry,2

"For me, prose walks, poetry dances.",James Broughton,poetry,2

"Slowly poetry becomes visual because it paints images, but it is also musical: it unites two arts into one.",Eugenio Montale,poetry,2
There is also poetry written to be shouted in a square in front of an enthusiastic crowd. This occurs especially in countries where authoritarian regimes are in power.,Eugenio Montale,poetry,2

"I know I'm not a wordsmith. And I don't write poetry. Sometimes I think I should, because it's really helpful. But I always wanted to write novels.",Candace Bushnell,poetry,2
"I'm not really one for fancy, big words and poetry, and the scriptwriters worked very hard on 'Paradise Lost' to translate it.",Callan McAuliffe,poetry,2
"A lot of people think, 'I'll give acting or poetry or filmmaking a try. And if it doesn't work out I'll go get a law degree, do something else that's more practical.' For me I went the reverse way. I lived the back-up plan.",Brit Marling,poetry,2
I come here to speak poetry. It will always be in the grass. It will also be necessary to bend down to hear it. It will always be too simple to be discussed in assemblies.,Boris Pasternak,poetry,2
I don't write poetry and then strum some chords and then fit the words on top of the chords.,Andrew Bird,poetry,2

It is true that short forms of poetry have been cultivated in the Far East more than in modern Europe but in all European literature short forms of poetry are to be found - indeed quite as short as anything in Japanese.,Lafcadio Hearn,poetry,2
I often imagine that the longer he studies English literature the more the Japanese student must be astonished at the extraordinary predominance given to the passion of love both in fiction and in poetry.,Lafcadio Hearn,poetry,2
"Art works because it appeals to certain faculties of the mind. Music depends on details of the auditory system, painting and sculpture on the visual system. Poetry and literature depend on language.",Steven Pinker,poetry,2

"Journalism is concerned with events, poetry with feelings. Journalism is concerned with the look of the world, poetry with the feel of the world.",Archibald MacLeish,poetry,2

The tradition of Russian literature is also an eastern tradition of learning poetry and prose by heart.,Ryszard Kapuscinski,poetry,2
"I don't think you get to good writing unless you expose yourself and your feelings. Deep songs don't come from the surface they come from the deep down. The poetry and the songs that you are suppose to write, I believe are in your heart.",Judy Collins,poetry,2
"A group of us started a community center in Santa Monica. We've tried different programs, and three have worked really well. A poetry group. Once a week we visit Venice High and talk to girls at risk.",Lisa Bonet,poetry,2

"I have experienced healing through other writers' poetry, but there's no way I can sit down to write in the hope a poem will have healing potential. If I do, I'll write a bad poem.",Marilyn Hacker,poetry,2
"When you translate poetry in particular, you're obliged to look at how the writer with whom you're working puts together words, sentences, phrases, the triple tension between the line of verse, the syntax and the sentence.",Marilyn Hacker,poetry,2
"Poetry seems to have been eliminated as a literary genre, and installed instead, as a kind of spiritual aerobic exercise - nobody need read it, but anybody can do it.",Marilyn Hacker,poetry,2

I can find some way to make poetry out of my life's experiences.,Shelby Lynne,poetry,2
"There are better ways we can transform this virulent hatred - by living our ideals, the Peace Corps, exchange students, teachers, exporting our music, poetry, blue jeans.",Helen Thomas,poetry,2
"It is the timber of poetry that wears most surely, and there is no timber that has not strong roots among the clay and worms.",John Millington Synge,poetry,2
"I think it comes from really liking literary forms. Poetry is very beautiful, but the space on the page can be as affecting as where the text is. Like when Miles Davis doesn't play, it has a poignancy to it.",Jim Jarmusch,poetry,2
"If you go into a bar in most places in America and even say the word poetry, you'll probably get beaten up. But poetry is a really strong, beautiful form to me, and a lot of innovation in language comes from poetry.",Jim Jarmusch,poetry,2
"I work on words, mostly, toward them being poetry or short stories, and then some of those become songs. They all find their place in the world, but they all start off in the same place. I'm always painting and drawing as well, and it's an ongoing creative assignment.",P. J. Harvey,poetry,2

"There is an urgent need for Americans to look deeply into themselves and their actions, and musical poetry is perhaps the most effective mirror available. Every newspaper headline is a potential song.",Phil Ochs,poetry,2
"When I really want to be soothed and reminded of why people bother to fiddle with sentences, I often read poetry.",Nicholson Baker,poetry,2
"From my music training, I knew that, some Spanish rhythms apart, 5/4 is a time signature used only in the modern era. Holst's Mars from the Planets is 5/4. But if you speak lines of poetry in that pattern you just end up hitting the off-beats. It's only when you add a rest - a sixth beat - that it sounds as it surely should sound.",Nicholson Baker,poetry,2
"So I really began as a failed poet - although when I first wanted to be a writer, I learned to write prose by reading poetry.",Nicholson Baker,poetry,2

"It's always good when women win things in fiction because it tends to be more male-dominated, unlike poetry, which is more equal.",Carol Ann Duffy,poetry,2
Poetry and prayer are very similar.,Carol Ann Duffy,poetry,2
Auden said poetry makes nothing happen. But I wonder if the opposite could be true. It could make something happen.,Carol Ann Duffy,poetry,2
"I grew up in a bookless house - my parents didn't read poetry, so if I hadn't had the chance to experience it at school I'd never have experienced it. But I loved English, and I was very lucky in that I had inspirational English teachers, Miss Scriven and Mr. Walker, and they liked us to learn poems by heart, which I found I loved doing.",Carol Ann Duffy,poetry,2

More people than ever are slowly but surely turning their ears toward poetry.,Saul Williams,poetry,2
I think we fool ourselves and really negate a great deal of history if we think that the oral history of poetry is shorter than the written history of poetry. It's not true. Poetry has a longer oral tradition than it does written.,Saul Williams,poetry,2

"On the other hand, if there's an underlying core of poetry that I go to, I go to the sea. I've lived on the sea all my life. I live on the sea in Cape Breton.",Richard Serra,poetry,2

"There is probably nothing wrong with art for art's sake if we take the phrase seriously, and not take it to mean the kind of poetry written in England forty years ago.",Allen Tate,poetry,2

"There have been two popular subjects for poetry in the last few decades: the Vietnam War and AIDS, about both of which almost all of us have felt deeply.",Thom Gunn,poetry,2
"And I know I'm supposed to feel guilty for wanting people to buy my books... and books in general? Novels and poetry, they belong to the realm of art. How dirty of us to try to hawk art!

"Still, language is resilient, and poetry when it is pressured simply goes underground.",Diane Wakoski,poetry,2
"Because, in fact, women, feminists, do read my poetry, and they read it often with the power of their political interpretation. I don't care that's what poetry is supposed to do.",Diane Wakoski,poetry,2
"I'm perfectly happy when I look out at an audience and it's all women. I always think it's kind of odd, but then, more women than men, I think, read and write poetry.",Diane Wakoski,poetry,2
PC stuff just lowers the general acceptance of good work and replaces it with bogus poetry that celebrates values that in themselves are probably quite worthy.,Diane Wakoski,poetry,2
"Distinctly American poetry is usually written in the context of one's geographic landscape, sometimes out of one's cultural myths, and often with reference to gender and race or ethnic origins.",Diane Wakoski,poetry,2
"From reading a previous answer, you know that I consider all those aspects to be part of American cultural myth and thus they figure into good American poetry, whether the poet is aware of what he is doing or not.",Diane Wakoski,poetry,2
"I don't like political poetry, and I don't write it. If this question was pointing towards that, I think it is missing the point of the American tradition, which is always apolitical, even when the poetry comes out of politically active writers.",Diane Wakoski,poetry,2
I have always wanted what I have now come to call the voice of personal narrative. That has always been the appealing voice in poetry. It started for me lyrically in Shakespeare's sonnets.,Diane Wakoski,poetry,2
"I think I'm a very good reader of poetry, but obviously, like everybody, I have a set of criteria for reading poems, and I'm not shy about presenting them, so if people ask for my critical response to a poem, I tell them what works and why, and what doesn't work and why.",Diane Wakoski,poetry,2
"I think that great poetry is the most interesting and complex use of the poet's language at that point in history, and so it's even more exciting when you read a poet like Yeats, almost 100 years old now, and you think that perhaps no one can really top that.",Diane Wakoski,poetry,2

"I believe that all poetry is formal in that it exists within limits, limits that are either inherited by tradition or limits that language itself imposes.",Mark Strand,poetry,2
"And yet, in a culture like ours, which is given to material comforts, and addicted to forms of entertainment that offer immediate gratification, it is surprising that so much poetry is written.",Mark Strand,poetry,2

"Humour is a fine line to walk in poetry, as in fiction. I just think it's harder to write. It's harder to keep the respect of the reader too.",George Murray,poetry,2
"I've often entertained paranoid suspicions about my fridge and what it's been doing to my poetry when I'm not looking, but I never even considered that my fan was thinking about me.",George Murray,poetry,2
The poetry community here has been extraordinarily welcoming.,George Murray,poetry,2
Then I discovered I loved writing poetry more than fiction.,George Murray,poetry,2

"I used to write sonnets and various things, and moved from there into writing prose, which, incidentally, is a lot more interesting than poetry, including the rhythms of prose.",Shelby Foote,poetry,2

"I love painting and music, of course. I don't know nearly as much about them as I know about poetry. I've certainly been influenced by fiction. I was overwhelmed by War and Peace when I read it, and I didn't read it until I was in my late 20s.",Kenneth Koch,poetry,2
"I was excited by what my painter friends were doing, and they seemed to be interested in our poetry too, and that was a wonderful little, fizzy sort of world.",Kenneth Koch,poetry,2

I have always written poetry but I have never applied it to songwriting.,Janine Turner,poetry,2
"We all need ways to express ourselves, and poetry is one of mine.",Jack Prelutsky,poetry,2

"I don't like poetry that just slaps violent words on a canvas, as it were.",Anne Stevenson,poetry,2

Poetry is at least an elegance and at most a revelation.,Robert Fitzgerald,poetry,2

"Poetry leads us to the unstructured sources of our beings, to the unknown, and returns us to our rational, structured selves refreshed.",A. R. Ammons,poetry,2
"The poet exposes himself to the risk. All that has been said about poetry, all that he has learned about poetry, is only a partial assurance.",A. R. Ammons,poetry,2
"That's a wonderful change that's taken place, and so most poetry today is published, if not directly by the person, certainly by the enterprise of the poet himself, working with his friends.",A. R. Ammons,poetry,2

"Theater is far superior to film in poetry, in abstract poetry.",Julie Taymor,poetry,2
"I was in Paris at an English-language bookstore. I picked up a volume of Dickinson's poetry. I came back to my hotel, read 2,000 of her poems and immediately began composing in my head. I wrote down the melodies even before I got to a piano.",Gordon Getty,poetry,2
